"`Read the Docs`_ is an excellent site for hosting project documentation. "
"It provides hooks into common project hosting sites like Github_ & "
"Bitbucket_ and can rebuild your documentation automatically whenever you "
"push new code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/readthedocs.rst:9
msgid ""
"The site is designed for documentation written with Sphinx and supports "
"Sphinx extensions via a correctly configured ``setup.py`` file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/readthedocs.rst:12
msgid ""
"As Breathe is a Sphinx extension you can use it on Read the Docs. "
"However, as Breathe requires doxygen XML files, some additional "
"configuration is required."

#: ../../source/readthedocs.rst:18
msgid ""
"Read the Docs do not explicitly support doxygen however they have had "
"requests for it to be supported and it is currently installed on their "
"build servers."

msgid "Generating Doxygen XML Files"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/readthedocs.rst:25
msgid ""
"We assume that you are not checking your doxygen XML files into your "
"source control system and so you will need to generate them on the Read "
"the Docs server before Sphinx starts processing your documentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/readthedocs.rst:29
msgid ""
"One simple way of achieving this is to add the following code to your "
"``conf.py`` file:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/readthedocs.rst:42
msgid ""
"The first line uses the ``READTHEDOCS`` environment variable to determine"
" whether or not we are building on the Read the Docs servers. Read the "
"Docs set this environment variable `specifically for this purpose`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/readthedocs.rst:46
msgid ""
"Then, if we are in a Read the Docs build, execute a simple shell command "
"to build the doxygen xml for your project. This is a very simple example;"
" the command will be determined by your project set up but something like"
" this works for the Breathe documentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/readthedocs.rst:51
msgid ""
"As this is then executed right at the start of the ``sphinx-build`` "
"process then all your doxygen XML files will be in place for the build."

msgid "A More Involved Setup"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/readthedocs.rst:57
msgid ""
"If you'd rather do something more involved then you can run ``doxygen`` "
"as part of a ``builder-inited`` event hook which you can install from "
"your ``conf.py`` file by adding a ``setup`` function as shown below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/readthedocs.rst:61
msgid ""
"This is an approximation of the code that Breathe has in its ``conf.py`` "
"in order to run ``doxygen`` on the Read the Docs server."
