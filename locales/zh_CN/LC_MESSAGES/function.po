"For functions which have a declaration and definition in separate files, "
"doxygen generates two entries for the function and Breathe can get "
"confused when faced with this. As a result Breathe ignores what it "
"considers to be the implementation files when searching for the XML for "
"the function documentation. In order to do this, it ignores any entries "
"in files which have filename extensions listed in the "
":ref:`breathe_implementation_filename_extensions <breathe-implementation-"
"filename-extensions>` config variable."
